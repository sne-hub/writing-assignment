If I don’t succeed in web development, I will study Information technology teaching, this is because I do not want to quit coding and programming. It will be a sad situation because I will not be able to open my academy. I might not be able to develop my application, that was supposed to make people’s lives more efficient so it will be a loss for many people especially those within the motor mechanic industry
