I wake up at around six am daily, I prefer doing everything during the early hours while my mind is still fresh. I will start dedicating to my schoolwork from eight am to seven pm taking breaks in between to clear my mind, per day I will dedicate about eight hours to my studies and do my chores for an hour. I usually sleep early at around nine or ten, this helps me rest well and wake up refreshed and ready to do my work.
