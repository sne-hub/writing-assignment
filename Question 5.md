I am a driven and dedicated person, I have been enthusiastic about coding and have dedicated myself to learning and developing within the programming industry. I am very curious, I am always willing to learn new skills, if I encounter a new concept that interests me, I make sure I research about it until I understand it well. I am persistent and I never quit, if I am given a task, I make sure I complete it and if I get a negative feedback, I redo my task and try to perfect it. I am a good team player and I have great communication skills. I am always willing to hear other people`s opinions and I understand that everyone makes mistakes. I love developing patterns, and drafting schedules for everything, if I have a task to complete, I make it a priority and work on it until I finish it before jumping to another task. If I am passionate about something I work hard to understand it fully and incorporate it to my everyday life.
