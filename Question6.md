I panic when I cannot meet deadlines or when the situations get hard, I tend to spend more time trying so to solve one problem, even if I can solve the others, I just want to finish the one I have started. Sometimes when I am facing academic pressure, I deprive my-self of sleep and keep on trying to get solutions, which decreases my productivity. I have also had a problem of trying to find the final product without understanding the steps needed to get to that solution. To prevent my panic attacks, I have been learning been watching YouTube videos explaining the terms and the syntaxes used in javascript. I have developed a strategy of solving the simplest questions before the hard ones and to also consult with my peers where I get stuck. To prevent spending more time on one problem, I have decided to break down each question before attempting to solve them so that I can decide which ones need more time and which ones are easier to solve. I will also give my self-time to rest and refresh so I can be productive, I will do my yoga before starting with my course work to avoid mental breakdowns and exhaustion.
