I am Sinenhlanhla Pearl Magubane, I was born in 1996 in a small village called Nquthu in KwaZulu-Natal. I started my primary school in a local primary, I studied there until grade 2 then I moved to Gauteng to live with my aunt. I completed my primary education at Tswaragano primary school and then later moved back to Nquthu for my high school education. The high school that I attended was a boarding school, but I was a day scholar which had its disadvantages. Learners who lived in hostels had extra classes that we could not attend because they were conducted in the evening. I always loved technology and science so in grade 10 I chose the technical stream and did mechanical technology, physical science and engineering graphics and design. I matriculated in 2013 and started working at my uncleâ€™s workshop helping him around until he then taught me about cars and the practical part of mechanical technology. In 2020 I moved to Alberton to start searching for greener pastures and to follow my dream which is Information technology, but I could not do it formally since I had no funds, I registered at an online institution called simpliLearn to learn the basics of computer programming.
