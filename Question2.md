In high school I started reading science fiction books and watched sci-fi movies and most of them were about imagining future in a scientific way. They used information technology to implement what they had imagined and that become what I wanted to do in my own real life. The creativity required within the web development profession attracted me towards this career, I love working in an environment where there is no routine, and I can express my ideas and learn from others. Web development is continuously evolving meaning it will keep me on my toes to also keep on learning, being creative and developing web applications.
