If I make it in the web development field, I would like to develop my own application which will help diagnose modern cars, it has become more difficult to diagnose cars using old mechanical techniques. In a village where I grew up, most people are computer illiterate, some learners graduate high school without the basic computer knowledge, some only use the computer for the first time once they reach tertiary even to this day. I have a dream of opening an academy where learners will be given an opportunity to learn computers and coding from a young age. I believe in molding future generation that will be better than my generation, I believe there is so much potential in children from remote areas that is not recognized because of lack of resources and opportunities
